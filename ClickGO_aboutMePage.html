                        <h2 class="section-title">MY BIOGRAPHY</h2>
                        
                        <p>Art Wolfe's love affair with photography began in the verdant landscapes of the Pacific Northwest. Born in Seattle, Washington, he was surrounded by the natural beauty of mountains, forests, and coastlines that would later become the subjects of his iconic imagery.</p>
                        
                        <p>With a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree and a Master of Fine Arts in painting from the University of Washington, Art brought an artist's eye to the world of photography. This unique background enables him to see beyond mere documentation, crafting images that are compositionally sophisticated and emotionally resonant.</p>
                        
                        <p>Over the past four decades, Art has traveled to every continent and worked in hundreds of locations around the globe. From the savannas of Africa to the ice fields of Antarctica, from the rainforests of South America to the temples of Asia, his camera has captured the incredible diversity of our planet.</p>
                        
                        <p>Art's work transcends traditional wildlife and landscape photography. He is a visual anthropologist, documenting indigenous cultures with respect and sensitivity. His images of tribal peoples in remote corners of the world serve as both art and archive, preserving traditions that are rapidly disappearing in our modern age.</p>
                        
                        <p>His photographs have appeared in major publications including National Geographic, Smithsonian, Audubon, Natural History, and countless others. He has published over 100 books, many of which have become classics in the field of nature photography.</p>
                        
                        <p>Art's photography is more than beautiful imagery—it's a call to action. Through his work, he advocates for wildlife conservation and the protection of Earth's remaining wild places. He believes that by revealing the beauty and fragility of nature, we can inspire people to become better stewards of our planet.</p>
